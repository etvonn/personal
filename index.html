        <p>Computer Engineer</p>
        <p>I am a computer engineering undergraduate at Iowa State University.
        I am studying embedded systems and hardware/software codesign.
        I have experience in Java, C, PCB design, and web development.

        I am also the assistant electrical director and battery protection system manager for the 
        university's solar car team, where I manage the overall function of the electrical subteam
        as well as my own project that monitors and manages a battery pack of ~1400 Lithium Ion Cells.

        <h3>PrISUm Solar Car: Battery Protection System</h3>
        <p>I have spent a year managing PrISUm Solar Car's battery protection system,
        which involves a group of sensor nodes that gather voltage and temperature data from
        a lithium ion battery pack, which are designed to report unacceptable voltage and temperature 
        measurements and ensure that all of the battery modules remain balanced. It also involves 
        It also includes a controller that is in charge of ensuring that the battey pack remains 
        disconnected until safe conditions are verified.
